# 📄 DocuSense – QA Automation

This repository contains **automated QA tests** for the [DocuSense](https://github.com/Jobayerdl9/DocuSense) project. The tests are built using **Playwright** and integrated with **GitHub Actions** to ensure continuous validation of the project.

## 🔹 Purpose
The automation focuses on testing the critical functionalities of DocuSense:

- Landing page loads successfully
- File upload (PDF, Image, Text) works correctly
- Document type detection logic functions as expected
- UI responsiveness across devices
- Edge-case scenarios and negative testing

This ensures that new updates in the main DocuSense project do not break existing functionality.
